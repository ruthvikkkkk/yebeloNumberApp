Design Patterns:
    Builder design pattern is used wherever necessary, it is achieved through Lombok.

Persistence:
    For persisting data, Postgres is used, the Category entity is used to define the schema

    Table Schema:

        Column     |          Type          | Collation | Nullable | Default
    ---------------+------------------------+-----------+----------+---------
     category_code | character varying(255) |           | not null |
     number        | bigint                 |           | not null |
    Indexes:
        "category_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (category_code)

Future Enhancements:

    - To further scale the project, a pub-sub model can be used to process the requests. Kafka, rabbiMQ or any other
        message queue can be used.

    - Redis can be used as a cache store, this cache can be used to maintain data of all the categories being accessed
        by the users. This would help to maintain a lock on the data being accessed i.e. enable optimistic locking
